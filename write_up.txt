Rules List:

One of the rules we used was swapping the order when a verb follows a noun. This is because in Turkish the object of the sentence comes before the verb whereas it comes after it in English.  For example:

Turkish: Kuru yapraklar hışır hışır ediyordu. 
Gloss: dry leaves crack crack was doing.
English: Dry leaves (were) doing 'crack, crack.'

(Punctuation added for increased fluency.)

A similar rule is when there is a noun phrase that comes before a verb. We replaced the verb to come before the noun phrase since the verb should be followed by the object. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell if the noun is the subject of the sentence, so this introduced some errors in cases where the subject directly preceded the verb.  For example, the following works well:

Turkish: Kayalıklara doğru var gücünü harcayarak yeniden koşmaya başladı. 
Gloss: to the rocks toward there is his strength while spending once again to run started.
English: Toward the rocks, while spending his strength, (he) once again started to run.

In this case, the re-write rules works specifically for the end, where we change "once again to run started" into "once again started to run."

If the sentence started by a verb and ended with one, then we pull the last verb next to the first one. In Turkish, predicate usually precedes the verb which is not the case in English. There wasn't an easy way to fix this in our corpus, but with some over-fitting this modified rule helped us.  Here's an example:

Turkish: Gitti, kendisini yaprakların üstüne attı.
Gloss: went his own the leaves above threw
English: (He) went (and) threw himself on the leaves.
